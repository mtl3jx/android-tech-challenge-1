## Overview
In this tech challenge, you will be creating a simple app that displays some text and a button, which takes the user to a second page that displays all the times the app has been opened.

## Learning Objectives
When completed the student should have an understanding of the following concepts:

* SDK installation
* Software installation on the target device.
* Basic application structure
* Application startup
* Application view display
* View transitions
* Table views
* Basic local storage
* Basic date formatting

## Prerequisites
Before starting this tech challenge, a student should be familiar with the follow concepts:

* General Java knowledge
* The Android SDK installed on the development device
* Android Studio (the latest stable release) installed on the development device

## Grading Criteria
Here are some specific requirements the graders will be looking for in your submission in order for your submission to be accepted: 

The application must do the following:

* If the application is a native application is should conform to the Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for the target device.
* Run and display a page displaying the words ‘Hello World’ centered on the top of the page and contain a button, centered half-way down the page.
* The button should readily appear to be a button to the user.
* When the user presses the button the application should display a second page.
* The second page must contain a list of all of the date/times that the application was run.    
* From the list page the user must be able to navigate back to the first page in a manner that conforms to best practices for the platform on which it is running.
* The list must be sorted by start date/time in ascending order.
* The display of the date/time should be in the format of the **current locale of the device.**
* The application must not crash or leak memory.
* The application must be deployed to a physical device.
* If a native application is developed it must have a custom icon.
* For native applications, it must operate correctly when the phone is in airplane mode.
* All storage of data must occur on the phone.

## Submission Instructions
Please provide these specific items when submitting your tech challenge, placing them inside of your repository where your grader can easily find them:

* An application that meets the above requirements running on the target mobile device is required for completion of this assignment. Please place the `.apk` file of the completed app in the base directory of your repository.
* The code for your submission should be at the base directory of the repo, or within a specified child directory.

### Git Workflow
* When you start a tech challenge, the tech challenge admin will create a private repository for you.
* There will be two branches in the repo, `master` and `develop`.
* Do all your work in the `develop` branch.
* As you work, push your changes up to your GitLab repo.
* When you are finished, make a merge request to the `master` version of your private repo.
* At this point, the graders will review your merge request and offer comments where needed.
* You may be asked to push updates, corrections to your develop branch in response to the coments by graders. You `don't` need to create another merge request.
* When the grader is satisfied, he will merge your code into the master branch of your private repo.
* Now celebrate, the Tech Challenge is completed!
